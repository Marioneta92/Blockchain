# U of M Fintech Bootcamp Certificate Minter
___
Project by Andres and Mario
## Overview
The project is a certificate minter that allows institutions to issue and verify digital certificates using blockchain technology. The minter is built using a combination of Python, Solidity, and Streamlit.

Python is what we used to create the backend logic and handle interactions with the blockchain.

Solidity is what we used to create the smart contract that manages the issuance and verification of the digital certificates.

Streamlit is the framework we used to create the user interface for the minter, allowing users to easily interact with the system.

Overall, the project combines the power of blockchain technology and modern programming tools to create a secure and efficient way for institutions to issue and verify digital certificates.
